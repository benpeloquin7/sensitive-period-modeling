	* Measurement tool
		+ test/questionaire
	* Measurement theory
		+ Pariticipant has unobserved trait (intelligence, knowledge...)
	* Questionaires often involve mapping discreted (binary) reponses onto unobserved traits that are assumed to be continuous	

[17:03]
	* Probability of observing a positive response will vary by item and by a person's level on the scale
	* Rasch model: logit person endorses item = wealth_person - cost_item

	* certain items are better or worse for assessing where a person is on the scale (precision at different parts of the scale (or different populations of people answering the questions))

	* desirable properties 
		+ each item should rank two individuals similarly
		+ each erson should rank two items similarly
		+ [27:30] the number of endorsements tells us about the train, their pattern does not 

	* two parameter model
		+ y_ij = a_i * \theta_j - b_i
			y_ij -> logit that item i is endorsed by person j
			\theta_j -> trait level of person j
			b_i -> difficult of item i (e.g. item threshold)
			a_i -> discrimination of item i (e.g. item slope or loading)
				-> correlation between item and latent trait

	* [44:10] basic model assume a monotonic relationship btwn latent trait and response probability
		+ alternative are unfolding IRT models
